                    <span class="pull-left team-bio"> Out of Site is a San Francisco nonprofit that provides free visual and performing arts programs for public high school students in San Francisco. Our programs fill a gap for teenagers â€“ not only are they not getting enough art in their schools but there are few safe, free, fun and challenging programs for teens. Students come to Out of Site looking for the chance to experiment in the arts, and for a place to be themselves-they find artistic training, new mediums for self-expression, and a diverse and supportive community.
